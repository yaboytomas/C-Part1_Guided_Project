You're developing a Student Grading application that automates the calculation of current grades for each student in a class. The parameters for your application are:

You're given a short list of four students and their five assignment grades.
Each assignment grade is expressed as an integer value, 0-100, where 100 represents 100% correct.
Final scores are calculated as an average of the five assignment scores.
Your application needs to perform basic math operations to calculate the final grades for each student.
Your application needs to output/display each studentâ€™s name and final score.

you'll use the assignment scores for each student to calculate their current grade in the class. To perform this calculation, you'll first sum the values of their assignment scores, and then calculate their average score (their current grade). Let's get started.

you'll calculate and store the average of the assignment scores from each student. Since you know the number of scored assignments for each student, the average is calculated by dividing the sum of the assignment scores by the number of assignments. To store the averages, you'll be using the Decimal data type.

you'll update your code to apply the finishing touches to the reported output. You'll start by adding a header row that includes the column labels specified by the teacher. After that, you'll use character escape sequences to add extra padding between the columns of information.
